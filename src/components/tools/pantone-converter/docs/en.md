# About This Tool

This Pantone Converter provides **unofficial approximations** of Pantone colors in digital formats (HEX, RGB, CMYK, HSL).

## Important Disclaimer

**Pantone® is a registered trademark of Pantone LLC.** This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Pantone LLC.

The color values provided here are approximate conversions intended for **reference purposes only**. They should not be used for:

- Official brand color specifications
- Print production requiring color accuracy
- Color-critical manufacturing processes
- Any application where precise Pantone color matching is required

## Why Approximations?

Pantone colors are physical ink formulations designed to produce consistent colors in print. Converting them to digital color spaces (RGB, HEX) or other print models (CMYK) involves inherent limitations:

| Color System      | Purpose                                | Limitations                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Pantone (PMS)** | Spot colors for precise print matching | Proprietary, requires physical swatch books    |
| **RGB/HEX**       | Screen display                         | Cannot represent all Pantone colors accurately |
| **CMYK**          | Process printing                       | Gamut is smaller than Pantone spot colors      |
| **HSL**           | Color manipulation                     | Mathematical conversion from RGB               |
